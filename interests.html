            I used to have a very big interest for computers and videogames hence why I chose to study technology. But all of that changed when I started watching a bunch of Self Improvement videos on youtube. 
I realized that I had basically wasted my life the past 10 years and I started focusing on bettering myself, mainly by fixing my diet and started going to the gym. I ended up falling in love with bodybuilding and fitness as a whole 
and now my goal is to build my dream physique and become the best version of myself and perhaps help other people with that when im there, who knows.
As my interest for fitness grew that kinda died down and now I'm almost feeling 
like I've made the wrong descision and that I should've gone with something training related.
