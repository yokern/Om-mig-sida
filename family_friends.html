            Me, my mom and dad, my two little sisters and our cat live together in a large yellow and white villa in the outskirts of Vallentuna.
I really love my family, even though we are all very busy we try to make the most ammount of time for eachother. 
We usually travel a lot together but because of covid we haven't traveled a lot lately. But we are planning on either
traveling to Hungary, where my mom was born, or America, which I much prefer :D. 
I don't have that many friends, but I don't really complain. I'd rather have fewer friends and a really close circle than
having a bunch of fake friends. I didn't really compete in any sports or activities when I was younger, probably a big mistake, and so
I have met all of my friends through school. I want to get to know more people but I'm very introverted and don't mind being by my self
which isn't necessarily a bad thing since when I need to focus I tend to focus really hard on what I'm doing and that's probably
one of the reasons I've been so successful at the gym the past months.
